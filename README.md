# P5
Project 5 for OpenClassrooms.
The goal for this project was to build the frontend part of an eCommerce Website.

For the existing frontend, clone the repository below and run "npm install" from within the project folder, and then run the server with "npm start" (requires Node installed on your machine and run locally).

For the backend, clone this repository, run "node server" or "nodemon" within the backend folder, and start up the live server in VS code.
