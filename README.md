# P5
Project 5 for OpenClassrooms.
The goal for this project was to build the frontend part of an eCommerce Website.

For the existing backend, clone the repository below and run "npm install" from within the project folder, and then run the server with "node server" or "nodemon" (requires Node installed on your machine and run locally).

For the frontend, clone this repository and start up the live server in VS code.
